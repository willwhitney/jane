# Jane

Jane is a purely voice-based chat client for Android.

## Usage

Jane works in the background. Whenever you push the button on a headset, she starts listening.

If you have the app in the foreground, you can use one of the phone's volume buttons or the button onscreen.

### Commands

- When you say `talk to <name>`, Jane changes the currently active conversation to that person, or tells you if she can't find anyone by that name.

- When you say anything else, Jane sends what you say to the currently active conversation.
